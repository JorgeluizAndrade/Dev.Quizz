## About the Project
Dev.quizz is a quiz with the following features:

<li>Interaction with OpenAI, it creates your questions and answers</li>
<li>JWT authentication to ensure user data security and protection.</li>
<li>Google authentication for easy and convenient login to the platform.</li>


## Database
Prisma with planetScale. 
## OpenAi
To implement ChatGPT's functionality, I have chosen to use prompts. These prompts allow us to create questions and answers.

## Technical problem

The project faces a "504 Gateway Timeout" error when interacting with the "questions" and "game" routes. This indicates that requests to fetch GPT-3 questions and manage games are exceeding the time limit, causing significant delay. The slowdown is negatively impacting the user experience and needs to be fixed. If you want help me, contact me on this email -> luizj1718@gmail.com.
